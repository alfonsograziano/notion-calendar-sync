# Introduction
Hi, this script is a porting of my personal Calendar/Notion sync script. I'm rewriting it in Typescript just for fun.

You should duplicate the Agenda database from [this template](https://alfonso-graziano.notion.site/ab2073d5c9e54a3f8735ba00609f0f7b?v=f1c82915c05347138ecb2d48bd6606d5).

Personally, I have deployied this script in AWS using Lambda and an EventBridge cron job of 5 minutes. Of course you can choose your preferred deploy system.
